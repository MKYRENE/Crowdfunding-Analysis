Report on Monthly Crowdfunding Data

Introduction:
In this report, we will analyze the monthly crowdfunding data provided and draw conclusions based on the data. The data includes the number of campaigns launched, number of campaigns successfully funded, average funding goal, and total amount pledged for each month of the year.

Conclusion 1:
Looking at the data, we can conclude that the month with the highest number of campaigns launched is January with 36 campaigns, followed by August with 35 campaigns launched. The month with the lowest number of campaigns launched is April with only one campaign launched.

Conclusion 2:
Another observation we can make from the data is that the month with the highest number of successfully funded campaigns is July with 58 campaigns successfully funded, followed by June with 55 campaigns successfully funded. The month with the lowest number of successfully funded campaigns is April with only 1 campaign successfully funded.

Conclusion 3:
The data also shows that the average funding goal for the campaignâ€™s ranges from 41 to 58 with the highest average funding goal in July and the lowest in August. Additionally, the total amount pledged ranges from 73 to 93 with the highest total amount pledged in July and the lowest in September.

Limitations:
One limitation of this dataset is that it only includes data for a single year, which may not be sufficient to draw long-term conclusions about crowdfunding campaigns. Additionally, the data only includes information on the number of campaigns launched, the number of campaigns successfully funded, the average funding goal, and the total amount pledged, which does not provide information on the success rate of the campaigns, or the amount pledged per campaign.

Other Possible Tables and Graphs:
To gain further insights from this dataset, we could create a table or graph showing the success rate of the campaigns. This could provide us with a better understanding of how successful the campaigns are in meeting their funding goals. Another possible table or graph could be the distribution of funding goals for the campaigns. This could help us understand the most common funding goals and how they relate to the success rate of the campaigns.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the data provides some valuable insights into the monthly trends of crowdfunding campaigns. However, to draw more comprehensive conclusions, it would be helpful to have data for multiple years and additional information on the success rate of the campaigns. By creating additional tables and graphs, we can gain further insights and understanding of the data.
